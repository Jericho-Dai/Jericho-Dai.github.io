### Welcome to my homepage！

### Ph.D. Candidate, USTC | Focus: Tumor Immunology

I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), with expected graduation in 2028. My research aims to understand the complex mechanisms driving **T cell exhaustion** within the **Tumor Immune Microenvironment (TIME)**, with the goal of optimizing immunotherapeutic strategies.

My interdisciplinary expertise spans both benchwork and bioinformatics:

#### Core Expertise:

* **Immunology Research:** Focused on T cell functionality and exhaustion profiling.
* **Wet Lab Techniques:** Proficiency in basic Biochemistry & Molecular Biology (BMB) experiments and advanced Flow Cytometry (FACS).
* **Computational Skills:** Bioinformatics data analysis, including single-cell and bulk sequencing processing, utilizing **Python** and **R** programming languages.

   ### T Cell Exhaustion in the Tumor Immune Microenvironment

   #### **Background**

T cell exhaustion is a state of T cell dysfunction that arises during chronic infections and cancer. Characterized by a progressive loss of effector function, altered transcriptional programs, and sustained expression of inhibitory receptors (e.g., PD-1, CTLA-4, LAG-3), exhausted T cells are less capable of proliferating, producing effector cytokines (e.g., IFN-γ, TNF-α), and mediating anti-tumor immunity.

   #### **Significance in Cancer Immunotherapy**

Within the complex and immunosuppressive Tumor Immune Microenvironment (TIME), T cell exhaustion represents a major barrier to effective anti-tumor responses. Understanding the intricate molecular and cellular mechanisms that drive and maintain T cell exhaustion is paramount for developing novel and enhancing existing immunotherapeutic strategies. Strategies targeting exhausted T cells, such as immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), aim to rejuvenate these dysfunctional cells, restoring their capacity to eliminate cancer cells and improving patient outcomes.
