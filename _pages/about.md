### Welcome to my homepage！

### Ph.D. Candidate, USTC | Focus: Tumor Immunology

I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), with expected graduation in 2028. My research aims to understand the complex mechanisms driving **T cell exhaustion** within the **Tumor Immune Microenvironment (TIME)**, with the goal of optimizing immunotherapeutic strategies.

My interdisciplinary expertise spans both benchwork and bioinformatics:

#### Core Expertise:

* **Immunology Research:** Focused on T cell functionality and exhaustion profiling.
* **Wet Lab Techniques:** Proficiency in basic Biochemistry & Molecular Biology (BMB) experiments and advanced Flow Cytometry (FACS).
* **Computational Skills:** Bioinformatics data analysis, including single-cell and bulk sequencing processing, utilizing **Python** and **R** programming languages.
